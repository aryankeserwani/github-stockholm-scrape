# github-stockholm-scrape

- This project scrapes data by requesting Github API to fetch users of followers more than 100 and having repositories not more than 500 from specific city through python code using Github token and then saving the json output into csv files.
- Users in Stockholm mostly prefer JavaScript language and majority of these developers work at Spotify company with highest numbers of developers from this city in this company.
- Consider implementing more repositories with project management tools (has_projects: true) to improve collaboration.
